With a view to making the writing more human, discuss how a human might approach this particular piece (given the original prompt). Discuss telltale LLM approaches to writing (generally) and ways they might not serve this particular piece. For example, common LLM failings are to write safely, or to always wrap things up with a bow, or trying to write impressively at the expense of readability. Then do a deep dive on the intention & plan, critiquing ways it might be falling into typical LLM tropes & pitfalls. Brainstorm ideas to make it more human. Be comprehensive. We aren't doing any rewriting of the plan yet, just critique & brainstorming.
