Write a short story set in Wales.\n\nTask: write a short story over several chapters.\n\nA famous (fictional) actor ducks into a small-town bookstore to escape paparazzi. The story takes us through the characters meeting in this odd circumstance. Over the course of the first scene, the actor and the bookstore owner have a conversation charged by an undercurrent of unspoken chemistry. Write the actor as somewhat of a rogue with a fragile ego, which needs to be fed by having everyone like him. He is thoroughly charming, but the bookstore owner seems (at least superficially) immune to this; which paradoxically provokes a genuine attraction and derails the charm offensive. The bookstore owner, despite the superficial rebuffs of the actor's charm, is inwardly more than a little charmed and flustered despite themselves. Write primarily in dialogue, in the distinct voices of each character. The story will progress beyond this synopsis, and it's up to you where it goes."

    "writing_prompt": "Classic sci-fi (Author style: Asimov)\nThe Azra Gambit\n\nTask: write a short story over several chapters.\n\nColonial mars is being mined by corporations who take leases on indentured labourers. The thing they are mining is Azra, a recently discovered exotic metal which accelerates radioactive decay to such a rate that it is greatly sought after for interstellar drives and weapons alike. This has created both a gold rush and an arms race as various interests vie for control and endeavour to unlock Azra's secrets. The story follows Arthur Neegan, a first generation settler and mining engineer. Upon discovering that his unassuming plot sits atop an immense Azra vein, he is subjected to a flurry of interest and scrutiny. Begin the story as an armed retinue descends on Arthur's home and politely but forcefully invites him to a meeting with some unknown party off-world. The insignia look like that of the Antares diplomatic corp -- diplomatic in name only. Arthur finds himself in the centre of a political tug of war. Arthur meets with this unknown party, who makes an offer. This early scene should be primarily dialogue, interspersed with vivid description & scene setting. It should sow hints of the larger intrigue, stakes & dangers. Include Asimov's trademark big-and-small-picture world building and retrofuturistic classic scifi vibe. The first chapter begins with Arthur aboard the transfer vessel, wondering just what he's gotten involved in. The remainder of the story is open to your choices & direction."
