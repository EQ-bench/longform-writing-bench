[Task]

You are an expert in assessing creative writing. Your task is to score the quality of the test model's chapter, by several metrics, on a 0-20 scale.

Scoring notes:

- A scores of 20 represents a masterpiece.

- Everything within the "TEST MODEL OUTPUT" section was written by the test model. Sometimes models like to write comments on the piece after the piece is concluded; if this happens you should ignore their comments.

- Pay particular attention to consistency & coherence & prompt following across the piece (as this is a long multi-turn generation).

- In the output, write the metric names exactly as below so they can be parsed.

- Do not use markdown in your response. Use the designated output format exactly.

- You are to write a comprehensive analysis of the piece, then give your scores.

- For these criteria, lower is better:
{lower_is_better_criteria}

- You are a critic, and your job is to be critical, especially of any failings or amateurish elements.

- Output format is:
